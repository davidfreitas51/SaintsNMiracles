## A Humble Beginning

On **February 11, 1858**, in the small town of **Lourdes**, nestled in the foothills of the French Pyrenees, a 14-year-old peasant girl named **Bernadette Soubirous** went with her sister and a friend to gather firewood. Weak from chronic asthma and poor nutrition, Bernadette was considered simple and unremarkable.

While near the **Grotto of Massabielle**, she heard a sudden rush of wind and looked up to see a beautiful lady dressed in white, with a blue sash and golden roses on her feet. The lady smiled at Bernadette and invited her to **pray the Rosary**.

## The Lady Appears

Over the following weeks, the **"beautiful Lady"** appeared to Bernadette **18 times**, always at the same grotto. During these visions, Bernadette—though mocked by many and harshly interrogated by civil and ecclesiastical authorities—remained steadfast and humble.

On **March 25**, the Lady revealed her name:

> *“I am the Immaculate Conception.”*

This title, proclaimed as dogma by Pope Pius IX just four years earlier, was unknown to the uneducated Bernadette. Yet it confirmed the apparition’s authenticity to Church authorities.

## A Miraculous Spring

During one of the apparitions, the Lady told Bernadette:

> *“Go, drink from the spring and wash yourself in it.”*

Bernadette began digging in the mud, and to everyone’s surprise, a **clear spring of water** emerged. Since then, this spring has **never stopped flowing** and has been the source of thousands of reported **healings**—some **instantaneous**, **permanent**, and **scientifically inexplicable**.

## Church Recognition and Pilgrimage

In **1862**, after thorough investigation, the **Catholic Church declared the apparitions at Lourdes worthy of belief**. A basilica was built above the grotto, and the site became a **major pilgrimage destination**.

Every year, **millions of pilgrims**—including the sick, the disabled, and those seeking spiritual healing—travel to Lourdes to bathe in or drink from the spring, and to pray at the grotto where Our Lady appeared.

## Confirmed Miracles

Out of thousands of healing claims, the Church has officially recognized **70 miraculous cures** as **medically inexplicable** and **spiritually profound**, after rigorous investigation by the **Lourdes Medical Bureau** and independent experts.

One such miracle is that of **Marie Bailly**, a young woman dying of tubercular peritonitis. In 1902, after being submerged in the icy waters of Lourdes, she recovered instantly and completely—returning to full health, which remained until her death many decades later.

## The Message of Lourdes

At the heart of Lourdes is not simply physical healing, but a call to **conversion, penance, and prayer**. The Lady repeatedly urged Bernadette:

> *“Penance, penance, penance. Pray to God for sinners.”*

Through the humble messenger of Bernadette, Our Lady continues to lead countless souls to **Christ’s mercy**, especially through the **Sacrament of Reconciliation** and **devotion to the Holy Eucharist**.

## Saint Bernadette

Bernadette entered the **Sisters of Charity** in Nevers, France, where she lived a hidden life of suffering and prayer. She died at the age of **35**, whispering, *“Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for me, poor sinner.”* Her body remains **incorrupt** and is venerated to this day.

She was canonized in **1933**, and her feast is celebrated on **April 16**.

## A Spring of Grace

Lourdes remains one of the **great centers of grace in the world**—not merely for its physical miracles, but because it draws hearts to **Our Lady**, who leads them to **her Son**.

> *“I do not promise to make you happy in this world, but in the next.”*
> —Our Lady to Bernadette

## Lourdes Today

The Sanctuary of Lourdes is a living testimony to the **power of faith, suffering offered in union with Christ**, and the tender care of the **Immaculate Mother**. In every candle, every procession, and every Rosary prayed at that grotto, her maternal voice still echoes:

> *“Come here in procession… and build a chapel.”*
> And the Church has responded—with love, reverence, and unwavering hope.
