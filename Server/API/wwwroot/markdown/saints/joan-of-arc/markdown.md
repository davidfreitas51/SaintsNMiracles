## A Peasant Girl with a Divine Mission

**Saint Joan of Arc**, known in French as _Jeanne d'Arc_, was born in **Domrémy**, a small village in northeastern France, around **1412**. She was the daughter of devout peasant farmers and grew up in the shadow of the **Hundred Years’ War**, a brutal conflict between France and England over control of the French crown.

From the age of thirteen, Joan began to experience what she described as **“voices”** from heaven—messages from **Saint Michael the Archangel**, **Saint Catherine of Alexandria**, and **Saint Margaret of Antioch**. These voices called her to a divine mission: to support the rightful French king and help liberate her country from English occupation.

## The Maid of Orléans

After gaining the trust of a local commander, Joan managed to secure an audience with **Charles VII**, the uncrowned heir to the French throne. Though still a teenager and unable to read or write, she impressed the royal court with her boldness, purity, and conviction. After thorough examination by theologians at Poitiers, she was given armor, a standard, and command of troops.

In **1429**, she led the French army to lift the **Siege of Orléans**, a major turning point in the war. Her presence alone inspired soldiers and civilians alike, and she insisted on strict moral discipline among the troops. That same year, she escorted Charles to **Reims**, where he was crowned king—a prophetic sign of her mission’s success.

## Betrayal and Martyrdom

Joan’s victories earned her admiration and suspicion. In 1430, during a skirmish at Compiègne, she was captured by Burgundian forces allied with the English. They sold her to the English, who were eager to destroy her reputation.

She was put on trial in Rouen by a pro-English **ecclesiastical court**, led by **Bishop Pierre Cauchon**. The trial was a sham: politically motivated, theologically biased, and filled with procedural abuses. Joan stood firm, answering complex theological questions with surprising wisdom and courage. She wore male military clothing to protect her modesty in prison—a choice that was used against her to accuse her of heresy.

On **May 30, 1431**, at just **nineteen years old**, Joan was burned at the stake. Her final word was **“Jesus.”**

## Rehabilitation and Canonization

In 1456, **twenty-five years after her death**, a Church investigation ordered by **Pope Callixtus III** declared her trial null and void, describing it as unjust and politically corrupt. Joan was officially exonerated and honored as a martyr.

Centuries later, she was beatified in **1909** and canonized in **1920** by **Pope Benedict XV**. Her feast day is celebrated on **May 30**, the anniversary of her martyrdom.

## Symbol of Faith and Courage

Saint Joan of Arc is a powerful symbol of **patriotic courage**, **feminine strength**, and **holy obedience**. She reminds the Church and the world that God can raise the humble to confound the proud, and that no one is too young, too poor, or too simple to become a great saint.

> _“Act, and God will act.”_

She is the **patroness of France**, soldiers, and those ridiculed for their faith. In a secular age, Joan continues to shine as a blazing witness of **purity, valor, and divine calling**.
