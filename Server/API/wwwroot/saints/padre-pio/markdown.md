## Early Life and Calling

**Saint Padre Pio**, born _Francesco Forgione_ on **May 25, 1887**, in Pietrelcina, Italy, grew up in a humble farming family deeply rooted in faith. From a young age, he showed a natural inclination toward prayer and devotion. At just 15, he entered the **Capuchin Franciscan friars**, embracing a life of strict discipline, poverty, and obedience.

## Mystical Gifts and Stigmata

Padre Pio became widely known for his **extraordinary spiritual gifts**, including the ability to read hearts, bilocation (being in two places at once), miraculous healings, and intense mystical experiences. His most famous and mysterious phenomenon was the reception of the **stigmata** in 1918—wounds resembling those of Christ’s crucifixion, visible on his hands, feet, and side.

For fifty years, Padre Pio bore these wounds openly, enduring physical pain and skepticism from some Church authorities. Despite initial investigations and restrictions, he was eventually vindicated by the Vatican, which recognized his sanctity.

Padre Pio’s daily routine centered around prayer, celebrating **daily Mass**, and hearing confessions. He is said to have spent up to 16 hours a day in the confessional, offering spiritual guidance and absolution to thousands.

His deep suffering—both physical and spiritual—was embraced as a participation in Christ’s passion. Padre Pio’s humility and patience, even amid trials, inspired countless people to deepen their faith.
