## Early Life

**Saint Francis of Assisi**, born _Giovanni di Pietro di Bernardone_ around 1181 in Assisi, Italy, came from a wealthy family of cloth merchants. He enjoyed a privileged youth, indulging in fine clothes, parties, and dreams of knighthood. Yet, beneath the surface of this carefree life, there was a restless soul searching for meaning.

## Conversion

A turning point came after a period of illness and captivity during a military expedition. Francis began to question the emptiness of worldly pursuits. He experienced a powerful encounter with Christ, especially through the poor and the lepers. One day, while praying in the dilapidated Church of San Damiano, he heard Christ speak from the crucifix: _“Francis, rebuild my Church, which you see is falling into ruin.”_ Taking this command literally, he began restoring local churches with his own hands.

When his father confronted him angrily, Francis renounced all claims to his inheritance, even stripping off his clothes in public as a sign of total detachment. From that moment, he embraced a life of **radical poverty**, walking barefoot, begging for food, and living among outcasts.

## Founding the Franciscan Order

His simplicity and joy attracted others. In 1209, he received papal approval from **Pope Innocent III** to found the _Order of Friars Minor_. These followers took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and preached the Gospel by their example rather than by elaborate sermons. Francis also inspired the founding of the _Poor Clares_, a contemplative order for women led by Saint Clare of Assisi.

## Love for Creation

Francis is often remembered as the _“patron of ecology”_ because of his deep reverence for nature. He saw all creatures as brothers and sisters, united under the Fatherhood of God. His poetic _Canticle of the Sun_ praises **Brother Sun**, **Sister Moon**, **Brother Wind**, and even **Sister Death**, recognizing God's presence in all of creation.

> _“Be praised, my Lord, through all your creatures.”_

## The Stigmata and Final Years

In 1224, while praying on Mount La Verna, Francis received the **stigmata**, the wounds of Christ in his own flesh. He bore these marks quietly, suffering with patience and humility. Though his health declined, his joy never left him.

He died on **October 3, 1226**, lying on the bare ground as he had requested, surrounded by his brothers, while singing Psalm 142. Two years later, he was canonized by **Pope Gregory IX**.

## Legacy

Saint Francis’s life remains a beacon of **humility**, **peace**, and **total trust in God**. His example challenges every age to live the Gospel without compromise. He is the patron saint of animals, the environment, and peacemakers. His feast day is celebrated each year on **October 4**.
