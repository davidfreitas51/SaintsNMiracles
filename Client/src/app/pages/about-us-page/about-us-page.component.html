    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      This project was born from a desire to make the beauty and richness of
      Catholic tradition more accessible to people across the world. We believe
      that the lives of the saints and the miracles granted through God‚Äôs grace
      are not distant tales from the past, but signs of hope and reminders of
      God's ongoing presence in human history.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      Our mission is simple: to gather, preserve, and share trustworthy
      information about canonized saints and authenticated miracles in a way
      that is reverent, engaging, and faithful to the teachings of the Catholic
      Church.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      Every saint featured here has walked a unique path of holiness, and every
      miracle presented points beyond itself to the mercy and mystery of God.
      Whether you're a devout Catholic, a curious seeker, or someone
      encountering these stories for the first time, we welcome you with open
      arms.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      This project is particularly inspired by
      <strong>Blessed Carlo Acutis</strong>, a young man who used his passion
      for technology to glorify God and spread Eucharistic devotion. His love
      for the Church and his initiative to catalog miracles digitally deeply
      influenced the vision behind this site.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      The work is also carried out under the loving patronage of
      <strong>Saint Joseph</strong>, my personal patron and model of humility,
      hard work, and fatherly devotion. May his silent strength accompany all
      who pass through this space.
    </p>

      My name is David. I'm a 21-year-old Catholic software developer from
      Brazil who loves to build meaningful things and serve the Church through
      my talents. As someone who‚Äôs naturally introverted, I‚Äôve always admired
      those who live their faith quietly but deeply‚Äîlike Saint Joseph, my
      devotion saint.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      This website is my small contribution to the digital mission of the
      Church. Inspired by Carlo Acutis and sustained by the sacraments, I wanted
      to create a space where the stories of holiness and God‚Äôs wonders could be
      shared in a beautiful and faithful way.
